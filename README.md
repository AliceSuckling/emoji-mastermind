## Development
To run the development server use `npm start`. This will initialize the webpack dev server on `localhost:8001`. This has been set up with [react component hot loading](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader).

## Build / Production
To build the application for production/deployment, run `npm run build`. This will bundle the application and compress all files. The `dist/` directory will be created containing the application.


## Testing
### Karma / Unit Testing
To run all tests using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/), run `npm test`. Use `npm test:watch` to continually run tests during development.

### Storybook
To start the react [storybook server](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook), run `npm run storybook`
